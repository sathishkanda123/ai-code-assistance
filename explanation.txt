The code defines a deep learning model that has three layers. 
The first layer has 128 neurons, the second layer has 64 neurons, and the third layer has 1 neuron. The activation function for each layer is relu. The model is compiled with the adam optimizer, the binary_crossentropy loss function, and the accuracy metric.

Let's break down the code step by step:

The first line imports the Sequential class from the tensorflow.keras.models module.
 This class is used to create a sequential model, which is a type of deep learning model that is made up of a linear stack of layers.
The second line creates a new instance of the Sequential class and adds three layers to it.
The first layer is a Dense layer with 128 neurons. The second layer is also a Dense layer with 64 neurons. The third layer is a Dense layer with 1 neuron.

The third line defines the activation function for each layer. 
The activation function is a mathematical function that is applied to the output of each layer. In this case, the activation function for each layer is relu, which is a rectified linear unit function.

The fourth line compiles the deep learning model. 
The compilation process involves setting the optimizer, loss function, and metrics for the model. 
In this case, the optimizer is adam, the loss function is binary_crossentropy, and the metrics are accuracy.

The optimizer is responsible for updating the weights and biases of the model during training. 
The loss function measures the difference between the predicted output of the model and the actual output. 
The metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model during training and testing.
